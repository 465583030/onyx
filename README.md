## Onyx

### What is it?

- a cloud scale, fault tolerant, distributed computation system
- written in Clojure
- batch and stream processing hybrid
- exposes an *information model* for the description and construction of distributed workflows
- enabled by hardware advances in the last 10 years with respect to solid state drives and increased network speeds
- Competes against Storm, Cascading, Cascalog, Map/Reduce, Dryad, Apache Sqoop, Twitter Crane, and Netflix Forklift

### I built this because I wanted...
- an information model, rather than an API, for describing distributed workflows
- temporal decoupling of workflow descriptions from workflow execution
- an elimination of macros from the API that is offered
- plain Clojure functions as building blocks for application logic
- a very easy way to test distributed workflows locally, without buckets of mocking code
- a decoupled technique for configuring workflows
- transactional, exactly-once semantics for moving data between nodes in a cluster
- transparent code reuse between streaming and batching workflows
- friendlier interfaces to plug into IO for data sources
- aspect orientation without a headache
- to get away from AOT complilation and avoid dependency hell
- heterogenous jar execution for performing rolling releases

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and send a pull request to the master branch.

#### Branching

Onyx uses a similiar branching strategy to Clojure itself. Onyx uses semantic versioning, and each minor version gets its own branch. All work is done on master or feature branches and dropped into a major.minor.x branch when it's time to cut a new release. Pull requests into the master branch are welcome.

#### Commit rights

Anyone who has a patch accepted may request commit rights. Please do so inside the pull request post-merge.
