### 0.6.0

Release 0.6.0 removes the HornetQ messaging model and introduces peer-to-peer messaging via a pluggable transport layer. We currently support Netty and core.async, the latter behind used for local development. Onyx has been extensively tuned to become very high performance, and is on par with other industry leaders. This release is *mostly* about improving performance, but a large number of small changes and features have also been introduced. See the [changelog](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.6.x/changes.md) for the entire list.

Upgrade notes:

- Onyx 0.6.0 is incompatible with prior releases.
