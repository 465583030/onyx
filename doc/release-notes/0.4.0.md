### 0.4.0

Release 0.4.0 ships directed, acyclic graph workflows, catalog-level grouping, and multiple bug fixes. 0.4.0 breaks backwards compatability with the previous release - 0.3.3. These changes are outlined below. See the changelog for full details.

- `:onyx/type` no longer accepts `:transformer`, `:aggregate`, or `:grouper`. Transformations are now *solely* specified with `:onyx/type` being keyed to `:function`.
- Grouping takes place inside the catalog entry by either setting `:onyx/group-by-key` or `:onyx/group-by-fn`. The former groups all segments with the same key value to the same Onyx peer. The latter uses a keyword that points to a function on the classpath to group segments by an arbitrary function.
- Aggregation can happen implictly anywhere, and is fully in the hands of the useer.
- Workflows may now be a vector-of-vectors, which specifies a directed acyclic graph. See the information model documentation for a full specification. Onyx remains fully backwards compatible with the original tree-based workflows that it shipped in 0.3.x.

Upgrade notes:

- Onyx 0.4.0 is incompatible with previous versions, and requires a restart of the Coordinator and all Peers.

Misc:

- Transducer support will be moved to release 0.5.0, and will be held until Clojure 1.7.0 officially ships.
