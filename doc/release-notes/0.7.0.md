### 0.7.0

Release 0.7.0 drastically improves messaging performance by bringing Aeron in as it's default transport layer. Netty and core.async are still maintained as alternate transport layers. This release switches all plugin interfaces to use protocols instead of multimethods. Along with this change, Onyx now offers the ability to directly call into Java via the `:onyx/language` catalog entry key. In addition, Onyx now emits a large amount of metrics via its new monitoring API. See the [changelog](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.7.x/changes.md) for the entire list.

Upgrade notes:

- Onyx 0.7.0 is incompatible with prior releases.
