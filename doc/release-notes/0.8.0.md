### 0.8.0

Release 0.8.0 brings automatic state management, recovery, windowing, and triggers. State is striped durable to BookKeeper logs, and segments are deduplicated using embedded RocksDB. Multiple types of aggregations are supported out of the box for rolling up data over time. Additionally, the new Windowing API allows developers to specify over what time interval data should be rolled up. Triggers are a companion feature to denote which stimuli force state to be synced via a user defined function. Finally, error messages have been dramatically improved with our custom schema printer. See the [changelog](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.8.x/changes.md) for the entire list of changes.

Upgrade notes:

- Onyx 0.8.0 is incompatible with prior releases.
