== Monitoring

When setting up an Onyx cluster in production, it's helpful to know what
Onyx itself is doing. Onyx exposes a set of callbacks that are triggered
on certain actions.

=== Reporters

When you're taking Onyx to production, it's not enough to know what your
application-specific code is doing. You need to have insight into how
Onyx is operating internally to be able to tune performance at an
optimal level. 


https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-peer-http-query[onyx-peer-http-query] contains a http://www.prometheus.io[prometheus] 
endpoint at https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-peer-http-query#route-2[`/metrics`].
Alternatively, any monitoring java agent that export JMX metrics can be used to
export metrics to other providers such as NewRelic.

== Health Checks

https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-peer-http-query[onyx-peer-http-query]
contains an https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-peer-http-query#route-1[Aeron health check] that 
we strongly recommend monitoring.

=== Task Monitoring

Onyx monitors numerous metrics related to each peer's task operations and states http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/cheat-sheet/latest/#/task-states[task-states].

Each of the following metrics is scoped by job id, task, and peer id in the following format:

JMX tag: job.JOBID.task.TASKNAME.peer-id.PEERID.METRIC ATTRIBUTE_NAME VALUE

Prometheus tag: METRIC_VALUETYPE{job=JOBID, task=TASKNAME, peer_id=PEERID} VALUE

==== Latency Metrics

|=== 
|Metric | Description
| recover_latency
| Time to fully recover the job after reallocation. Measured from the time the coordinator sends barrier with epoch 0.

| checkpoint_serialization_latency 
| Latency to serialize the checkpoint for the task.

| checkpoint_store_latency
| Latency to store the checkpoint in durable storage.

| serialization_latency
| Latency to serialize segments for messaging.

| since_heartbeat
| Maximum time since a heartbeat has been received from all peers. This is a good gauge of when a peer may be timed out.

| task_lifecycle_apply_fn
| Latency to call `:onyx/fn` on a batch of messages.

| task_lifecycle_read_batch
| Latency to read a batch of messages from messenger or the input medium.
| task_lifecycle_write_batch
| Latency to write a batch of messages to the messenger or the output medium.

==== Gauges / Counters

|=== 
|Metric | Description
| checkpoint_size
| Size of the last checkpoint.

| checkpoint_read_bytes
| Number of bytes read from checkpointed storage.

| checkpoint_written_bytes
| Number of bytes written to checkpointed storage.

| replica_version
| The job's allocation replica version that the peer is currently processing. All peers should have the same replica_version in normal operation, as peers with different replica versions are quarantined from each other.

| epoch
| The barrier epoch that the peer is up to.

| subscription_errors
| Number of errors thrown by messenger subscription. 

| publication_errors
| Number of errors thrown by messenger publication. 

| written_bytes
| Total number of bytes written via the messenger

| read_bytes
| Total number of bytes read from the messenger

==== Rate Metrics

|=== 
|Metric | Description
| epoch_rate
| Barrier flow rate.

| task_lifecycle_apply_fn_throughput
| Throughput for `:onyx/fn` application in segments.

| task_lifecycle_read_batch_throughput
| Throughput read from the input medium or messenger in segments.

| task_lifecycle_write_batch_throughput
| Throughput written to output medium or messenger in segments.

=== Coordination Monitoring Events

This is the list of all monitoring events that you can register hooks
for. The keys listed are present in the map that is passed to the
callback function. The names of the events should readily identify what
has taken place to trigger the callback.
