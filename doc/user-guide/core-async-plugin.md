#### Attributes

This plugin does not use any attributes.

#### Lifecycle Arguments

References to core.async channels must be injected for both the input and output tasks.

##### `read-from-chan`

```clojure
(defmethod l-ext/inject-lifecycle-resources :my.input.task.identity-or-name
  [_ _] {:core.async/chan (chan capacity)})
```

##### `write-to-chan`

```clojure
(defmethod l-ext/inject-lifecycle-resources :my.output.task.identity-or-name
  [_ _] {:core.async/chan (chan capacity)})
